                How can this be?
                Why is he the chosen one?
                Saint gone astray
                With a scepter and a gun
                Learn to believe
                In the mighty and the strong
                Come bleed the beast
                Follow me it won't be long
                Listen when the prophet speaks to you
                Killing in the name of God
                Passion twisting faith into violence
                In the name of God
                Straight is the path leading to your salvation
                Slaying the weak
                Ethnic elimination
                Any day we'll all be swept away
                You'll be saved as long as you obey
                Lies, tools of the devil inside
                Written in Holy disguise
                Meant to deceive and divide us all
                Listen when the prophet speaks to you
                Killing in the name of God
                Passion twisting faith into violence
                In the name of GodBlurring the lines between virtue and sin
                They can't tell where God ends and mankind begins
                They know no other life but this
                From the cradle they are claimed
                Listen when the prophet speaks to you
                Killing in the name of God

            </P>

                Passion twisting faith into violence
                In the name of God
                Hundreds of believers
                Lured into a doomsday cult
                All would perish in the name of God
                Self-proclaimed messiah
                Led his servants to their death
                Eighty murdered in the name of God
                Forty sons and daughters
                Un-consenting plural wives
                Perversions in the name of God
                Underground religion
                Turning toward the mainstream light
                Blind devotion in the name of God
                Justifying violence
                Citing from the Holy Book
                Teaching hatred in the name of God
                Listen when the prophet speaks to you
                Killing in the name of God
                Passion twisting faith into violence
                In the name of God
                In the name of God
                Religious beliefs, fanatic obsession
                Does following faith lead us to violence?
                Unyielding crusade, divine revelation
                Does following faith lead us to violence?
